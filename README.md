# Tesla Model 3 turn signal stalk
### The problem...
The new stalkless design is futuristic and works great. No problems with shifting gears, no problems to turn left or right.
But as soon as you're living in Europe with round-a-bouts everywhere. Especially those shared with cyclists. It's confusing to signal you're leaving the round-a-bout. You have to look at the steeringwheel and use *thought* to press the correct button.
In the mean time you're about to run over a cyclist because you looked at the steering wheel.
### The "solution"
Luckily [Enhauto](https://enhauto.com/) introduced the *Commander* and the *S3XY-buttons*. With these buttons you can automate many actions via wireless buttons. For more informatiom visit their [website](https://enhauto.com/).<br>
Using their buttons I created a 3D model af a turnsignal stalk integrating 2 of their buttons.<br>

Please note that this is a hobby project and the information is for hobbiests out there who want make their own stalk. You have to be creative to buildt it.

# Partslist:
- Commander + 2x S3XY buttons - [Link](https://enhauto.com/product/four-s3xy-buttons-gen2)

- 2x Small push button switches - [Link](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005002571813750.html)
- 8x Small round magnets (4x2mm) to hold the top cover - [Link](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005005282318653.html)
- Some pieces of wire to solder the buttons to the S3XY-button PCB
- 2mm bolt and nut
- Springs from a pen
- Sandingpaper to smoothen the 3D print
- A 3D printer, I use a Prusa MK2

# Building:
Please use your own imagination when building this. I forgot to take pictures during the build.<br>
Also make sure you have installed the *Commander* and have tested the *S3XY-buttons* in your car before proceeding. Soldering on your *S3XY-buttons* will void their warranty.
- 3D print the parts: base, stalk and cover.
- Sand them to make them nice and smooth.
- If you want the color to be darker after sanding you can spray a matt or shiny clear coat on top of it. I didn't do that.
- Insert the 3 ball bearings in the stalk.
- Glue 4 magnets in the holes on top of the base. Make sure the polarity of the magnets is all the same.
- Glue 4 magnets in the holes on the inside of the cover. Make sure the polarity of the magnets is oriented that it will attract the magnets on the base.
- Place the cover over the stalk.
- Solder wires to the contact pins of the 2 switches.
- Insert the switches in the base and pull the wires through the slots.
- Insert the stalk in the base, not that the thicker part of the base will be facing down. So make sure the stalk is oriented the correct way.
- Insert the spring over the stalks of the buttons and into the holes of the stalk. This is a tedious job.
- Insert the bold and nut, making sure it goes trough the ball bearings.
- Open up the S3XY-buttons and remove the covers.
- Solder the wires of each button to the small middle contact points on the original switch. (You don't have to remove the original switch).<br>Keep the wires as short as possible.
- Place the S3XY-buttons on each side of the base.
- **Test** the stalk **before placing the cover**.
- If it works well place the cover on. You might have to sand of some corners to get the cover on. You have to twist it a bit. Design needs to be improved... but hey it's working ;)
- Add the stickers which come with the *S3XY-buttons*.
- Add double sided tape to the bottom and stick it to the steering column of your Tesla Model 3 Highland.
  
As I said before, it's a hobby project and needs some tweaking on your side, but it works and was fun to create.
