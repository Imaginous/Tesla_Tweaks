# Tesla Model 3 turn signal stalk
### The problem...
The new stalkless design is futuristic and works great. No problems with shifting gears, no problems to turn left or right.
But as soon as you're living in Europe with round-a-bouts everywhere. Especially those shared with cyclists. It's confusing to signal you're leaving the round-a-bout. You have to look at the steeringwheel and use *thought* to press the correct button.
In the mean time you're about to run over a cyclist because you looked at the steering wheel.
### The "solution"
Luckily [Enhauto](https://enhauto.com/) introduced the *Commander* and the *S3XY-buttons*. With these buttons you can automate many actions via wireless buttons. For more informatiom visit their [website](https://enhauto.com/).<br>
Using their buttons I created a 3D model af a turnsignal stalk integrating 2 of their buttons.<br>

Please note that this is a hobby project and the information is for hobbiests out there who want make their own stalk. You have to be creative to buildt it.

## Partslist:
- Commander + 2x S3XY buttons - [Link](https://enhauto.com/product/four-s3xy-buttons-gen2)
- 3x Small ballbearings (6x3mm - hole 2mm) - [Link](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005005167956088.html)
- 2x Small push button switches - [Link](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005002571813750.html)
- 8x Small round magnets (4x2mm) to hold the top cover - [Link](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005005282318653.html)
- Some pieces of wire to solder the buttons to the S3XY-button PCB
- 2mm bolt and nut
- Springs from a pen
- Sandingpaper to smoothen the 3D print
- A 3D printer, I use a Prusa MK2
- ASA black filament (for it's durability, high temperature resistance and UV stability)
- Some glue
- Some double side (automotive grade) tape
- Optional glossy or matte clear varnish spray to give it a deeper black look after sanding.
- 3D Models can be found under releases

## Building:
Please use your own imagination when building this. I forgot to take pictures during the build.<br>
Also make sure you have installed the *Commander* and have tested the *S3XY-buttons* in your car before proceeding. Soldering on your *S3XY-buttons* will void their warranty.
- 3D print the parts: base, stalk and cover.
- Sand them to make them nice and smooth.
- If you want the color to be darker after sanding you can spray a matt or shiny clear coat on top of it. I didn't do that.
- Insert the 3 ball bearings in the stalk.
- Glue 4 magnets in the holes on top of the base. Make sure the polarity of the magnets is all the same.
- Glue 4 magnets in the holes on the inside of the cover. Make sure the polarity of the magnets is oriented that it will attract the magnets on the base.
- Place the cover over the stalk.
- Solder wires to the contact pins of the 2 switches.
- Insert the switches in the base and pull the wires through the slots.
- Insert the stalk in the base, not that the thicker part of the base will be facing down. So make sure the stalk is oriented the correct way.
- Insert the spring over the stalks of the buttons and into the holes of the stalk. This is a tedious job.
- Insert the bold and nut, making sure it goes trough the ball bearings.
- Open up the S3XY-buttons and remove the covers.
- Solder the wires of each button to the small middle contact points on the original switch. (You don't have to remove the original switch).<br>Keep the wires as short as possible.
- Place the S3XY-buttons on each side of the base.
- **Test** the stalk **before placing the cover**.
- If it works well place the cover on. You might have to sand of some corners to get the cover on. You have to twist it a bit. Design needs to be improved... but hey it's working ;)
- Add the stickers which come with the *S3XY-buttons*.
- Add double sided tape to the bottom and stick it to the steering column of your Tesla Model 3 Highland.
  
As I said before, it's a hobby project and needs some tweaking on your side, but it works and was fun to create.


# Tesla Paddles (Flippers)
### The challenge...
I like the *S3XY-buttons*, but I like the clean look and feel of my Tesla Model 3 (2024). So I like to have my buttons out of view.<br>
When stuck to the back of the steering wheel they are out of sight, but not so easy to press.<br>
I saw some complicated designs for paddles on sites like Thingiverse, but I thought it should be easier. So I designed minimalistic paddles which contain the PCB of a *S3XY-Button* (Gen1) without modifications. All you need is to 3D print it and stick the PCB inside with a bit of (automotive) foam double sided tape.

### The "solution"
Luckily we can use the [Enhauto](https://enhauto.com/) *Commander* and the *S3XY-buttons*. With these buttons you can automate many actions via wireless buttons. For more informatiom visit their [website](https://enhauto.com/).<br>
Using their buttons I created a 3D model af a paddle (left and right) integrating 1 of their buttons in each.<br><br>
**Note:** *I'm printing the second one at the moment and when both are installed I will take some pictures how it looks in my car.*

## Building:
You can bend the flipper part a bit upwards and slide in the *S3XY-Button* PCB into the slot. Note the notch which falls into the semi-circle cutout in the PCB.<br>
Also make sure you have installed the *Commander* and have tested the *S3XY-buttons* in your car before proceeding.
- 3D print the part. You can use the **brim** file to make the ASA adhere to the print bed better.<br>Also print the part upright, so a continous loop of filament will be created per layer. This is important for the flexability and durability of the print.
- Sand them to make them nice and smooth.
- If you want the color to be darker after sanding you can spray a matt or shiny clear coat on top of it. 
- Open up the *S3XY-button* and remove the cover.
- Add a piece of double sided tape to the battery compartment.
- Place the *S3XY-button* in the paddle by lifting it a bit, note the notch in the print and PCB.
- Add double sided tape to the bottom of the paddle to stick it to the steering wheel, the extentions of the paddle are designed to point down.
  
**Note:** you can insert a paperclip into the small holes on top of the paddle to push the *CR2032* battery out when it needs replacing. So you don't have to remove the PCB.<br>
As I said before, it's a hobby project and needs some tweaking on your side, but it works and was fun to create.
